# RateYourMusic-data-converter

Script for converting data from RateYourMusic into text which includes rating date, artist's and album's name, release year and personal rating.

It requires copy-pasted data from https://rateyourmusic.com/collection/YOURUSERNAME/r0.5-5.0 (ctrl-A, ctrl-C, ctrl-V into file). For now, it should be put into "in.txt" in the same location as the script. The result is "out.txt" which containes all RegEx found ratings, each in new line, fields are tab separated for easy importing into Excel and similar.

Will be updated to scrape data and require only an username on RYM
